# FlapPyBird with Pose Detection

A Flappy Bird Clone made using python-pygame with added pose detection controls using MediaPipe.

Make the bird flap by jumping
The game is from a flappy clone using pygame from 
https://sourabhv.github.io/FlapPyBird. I only added src/
flappy_jump.py and utils/pose_detector.py into the base 
game.
